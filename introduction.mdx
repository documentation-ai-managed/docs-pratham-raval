Follow these guidelines to maintain brand consistency.

- **Primary Color:** `#3B82F6` (use for buttons, links, and accents)
- **Usage:** Apply to CTAs and headers for a professional blue tone evoking trust.

```css
/* Example CSS usage */
.primary-button {
  background-color: #3B82F6;
  color: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
}
```

Avoid altering the hex value. Test accessibility with white text for contrast ratios `{>4.5:1}`.
